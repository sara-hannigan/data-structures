5 loops

Loop one:
key[0] = ROOT, so this is the ROOT KEY
key[0] = 4
left[0] = 1 (index of LEFT child)
right[0] = 2 (index of RIGHT child)

Loop 2:
key[1] = 2  (vertex 1 = 2 - so left child of 4 is 2)
left[1] = 3 (Index of LEFT child of key1)
right[1] = 4 (index of RIGHT child of key1)

loop 3:
key[2] = 5 (Vertex 2 = 5, so right child of 4 is 5)
left[2] = null (no children for 5)
right[2] = null (no children for 5)

Loop 4:
key[3] = 1 (vertex 3 = 1, so left child of key1(2) is 1)
left[3] = null (no children for 3)
right[3] = null (no children for 3) 

Loop 5:
key[4] = 3 (vertex 4 = 3, so right child of key1(2) is 3)
left[4] = null
right[4] = null


Stored in arrays of key, left, right

InOrderTraversal Pseudocode:
If param is nill, returns
Takes a root
Goes down all the way to the left
prints the root
Then all the way down to the right

PreOrderTraversal Pseudocode:
If param is nill, returns
Takes a root
Prints the root
Then goes down the left
Then goes down the right

postOrderTraversal Pseudocode:
If param is nill, returns
Goes all the way down the left
Goes all the way down the right
Prints the root
